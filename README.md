# Tavern Tales

This is a web UI to play Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) in the play by post (pbp) style.

D&D is a popular fantasy role playing game usually played around a table with
pen and paper. However one way of playing the game is play by post, where the
game is played not in person but by sending messages.

This service looks to help with that play style through modern web tech.

This is just a prototype I'm tinkering with.
